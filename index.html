            The Kindertransport project brought 10,000 unaccompanied German and
            Austrian children to Great Britain in 1939. Recent research has
            uncovered an inconvenient truth, many children suffered abuse,
            obstacles to integration when their stay became permanent, social
            estrangement, and forced conversions to Christianity.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of those children, Martha Braun, was ripped from the embrace of
            a loving, supportive Hamburg family, and brought into the Manchester
            home of a first cousin. There she was subject to mental abuse,
            barred from attending school and made to become the household’s
            unpaid servant until, in her own words, “I escaped”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The historical momentum that brought Martha to Manchester was set in
            motion over 100 years before her arrival. Elements within Germany
            began introducing a racial dimension to wide spread anti-Jewish
            sentiment, and the blood coursing through Jewish veins became an
            indelible stigma making them aliens within the society they were
            born into.
          </p>
          <p>
            Martha’s story is not only about the destruction of one family, it
            is an insight into what can happen when society abandons the
            standards cementing morality into its social fabric. It is a story
            for today.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Looking back on nearly eight decades I can truly say that I have
            lived an interesting life. A drop out humanities student at age 19,
            I worked as a textile dyer, quality controller, cost accountant,
            professional accountant, management consultant and tertiary lecturer
            in the discipline of management accounting. I am also happy to say
            that I am still married to the same woman I first met as teenager
            and have two accomplished daughters who are married to accomplished
            husbands who gifted us with five marvelous grandchildren
          </p>
          <p>
            I always loved reading and found history fascinating. When I retired
            from professional life and moved to Jerusalem, I finally had the
            time to devote to subjects I originally thought would be the means
            for earning my livelihood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the way I was fortunate to be accepted as a guide for the Yad
            Vashem History Museum. As a result, I tend to focus a major part of
            my reading on Jewish history, not only the years 1939-1945, but
            going back over the thousands of years which are the unfolding
            Jewish story.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also decided early on that I would like to tell others about
            interesting things I had read or was experiencing in this troubled
            but fascinating part of the world where we now live. I began writing
            a newsletter I named Yesterday Today and Tomorrow and this became a
            blog that appears on the platform of The Times of Israel.

        <h3>My blog</h3>
        <h2>Yesterday Today and Tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
          Yesterday I went to a concert celebrating the music of the Beatles.
          For me it was an evening of nostalgia, for the hundreds of young
          children in the audience many jumping in their seats, clapping hands
          and swaying in time to the music, it was a happy and carefree hour and
          a half.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it was fascinating to watch the music of my generation impact on
          5- and 6-year-olds, it was also sad that the vision for a better world
          embedded in the lyrics of those songs is now but a forlorn hope. That
          music embraced the promise of a new era for humanity, a time of hope,
          of peace, of love, whatever that meant, and we debated this concept at
          length! On the 25th June 1967, many yesterdays ago, the Beatles sang
          “All you need is love” to an audience of 400 million, the song became
          an anthem, exhorting my generation to change the world, to make it a
          better place for all. Unfortunately, we failed.
        </p>
        <p>So, if that was yesterday, what about today?</p>
        <p>
          Today universities are frightening places, mindless thugs embrace the
          evil that is Hamas and Hezbollah, they chant its slogans of hate and
          parade its flags. The mindless thugs are so stupid, so lacking in
          intuition that they are incapable of understanding they have been
          turned into mere pawns recruited to spread radical Islam, a movement
          bent on destruction but masquerading as a champion for the national
          aspirations of a people who embrace a death cult.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not only in the universities; the violence of this death cult
          has metastasized into the streets of Western Europe, America, Canada,
          Australia New Zealand and South Africa. Unchecked, radical Islam is
          manipulating democratic privilege to destroy the cultural inheritance
          and freedoms that gave it refuge from the violence and suppression of
          the countries from which it had fled. Today, the Jews are its target,
          but that is only the beginning. If this cancer that is radical Islam
          is not totally excised and removed, it will destroy all the
          institutions upholding the freedoms and civilisation that were fought
          for, and should be cherished and protected by those who lead our
          Western democracies.
        </p>
        <p>
          And today I watch with horror as the death cult that is Hamas
          celebrates the murders of Ariel and Kfir Bibas and their mother Shiri
          before handing them over to the Israel Defense Force representatives
          waiting to receive the bodies. Kidnapped from their home in October
          2023, then taken to Gaza as hostages, 9-month-old Ariel, 4-year-old
          Kfir, and 32-year-old Shiri were murdered one month later. The bodies
          were supposed to have been handed over quietly, in private, but evil
          always relishes an opportunity to cause pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forensic investigation has disclosed that the family was brutalized,
          murdered by hand, who or rather what puts its hands around the neck of
          a 10-month-old baby and chokes it to death. The perpetrators represent
          everything that is alien to our own cherished concepts of what it
          means to be human; we human beings celebrate life and living, this
          species celebrates death and dying.
        </p>
        <p>And what about tomorrow, will it be more of the same?</p>
        <p>
          Will we have to watch again and again as masked evil parades the
          coffins of our murdered people in front of the International Red
          Cross, masquerading the myth of how hospitable they have been to the
          starved physically and mentally abused hostages who yesterday had been
          imprisoned for 501 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will the mindless thugs continue to dictate the tone of intolerance,
          hatred, and violence that is the reality engulfing the university
          campuses supposed to be fostering the next generation of leadership
          for our western world?
        </p>
        <p>
          Will common sense return to dictate the policies driving public life?
          Is there still time to excise the cancer now inexorably destroying our
          western democracies; radical Islam, the fascist socialist left
          dedicated to creating a society that strives for mediocrity; or the
          radical fascism of the extreme right seeking a restoration of the
          Third Reich?
        </p>
        <p>
          Will common sense prevail, will the leadership of the Western
          democracies finally take action and expel the evil that is radical
          Islam from their midst? Or will they just continue to embrace it,
          because it is a voting block facilitating electoral victory. Will
          western leadership wake up and finally understand that you cannot take
          a salt water crocodile to bed and cuddle up to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, when will realisation come that Palestinian sovereignty
          is a myth, an elaborate con fabricated to keep millions of people in
          penury in order to deligitimise Jewish statehood. Since 1948 there has
          been opportunity after opportunity to take these people out of their
          wretchedness, but it has been refused. This is a classic case study of
          how leadership acting in its own interest took every opportunity to
          spit on every opportunity handed to them. The Palestinian leadership
          is corrupt, they have stolen billions of dollars in international aid
          and used it to support their own profligate lifestyles; to pay their
          own people to murder Israelis and become death cult martyrs; to turn
          their schools into factories of hate where children are taught to
          worship death; to manufacture rockets and build tunnels rather than
          build a society where their own people could lead normal fulfilling
          and productive lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fear that the answer to all of these questions is no, the world will
          not understand, it is too obsessed with removing the threat the Jews
          pose to society. And, the inconvenient truth behind all of this. The
          mobs and their puppet masters beating the Palestinian drum actually
          don’t give a damn about the Palestinians, if they did, they would
          endeavor to transform them from refugees only capable of receiving
          handouts into a functioning community dedicating their lives to
          building rather than destroying. I will paraphrase a succinct
          observation made by Alan Dershowitz, “the only reason the mobs and
          puppet masters have embraced the Palestinian cause is because the Jews
          are on the other side”!
        </p>
        <p>Yesterday, you are so far away!</p>
